# autogarden

This project aims to recreate a tropical environment that would enable tropical plants (ie. guanabana) to grow in non-tropical places. I plan to build a greenhouse environment using a small humidifer, a DHT11 thermo/hydro meter, a water pump, heater, a soil moisture sensor, a light sensor, and of course an Arduino.
