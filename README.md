# autogarden

This project aims to recreate a tropical environment that would enable tropical plants (ie. guanabana) to grow in non-tropical places. I plan to build a greenhouse environment using a small humidifer, a DHT11 thermo/hydro meter, a water pump, heater, a soil moisture sensor, a light sensor, and of course an Arduino.

# MVP's

[] Check soil moisture
[] Check ambient temperature and humidity
[] Check soil temperature
[] Check light levels

[] Water plant (timed or soil moisture levels?)
[] Increase humidity
[] Increase temperature (heater?)

# Things to think about
Control lighting?
Air flow?
